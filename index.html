      <h1>Before you lies the culmination of 23 years of effort known as Sheila.</h1>
      <p class="story">This photo was taken not long after Sheila was purchased, in rough shape. Sheila was purchased from eBay for $6,000 after having spent her whole life in California.
      She was built in Freemont, CA and originally purchased in San Diego before she was picked up by her current owner. She was previously licensed in 1988, and spent about 12 years parked outside under a tree.
      Her new owner, whilst still actively employed on a 9-5 schedule, devoted much of his free time to making her pretty again. She barely ran, after having not been taken care of for over a decade,
      but through perseverance (and lots of money spent) she was given a new chance at life, and boy does she look good living it.

      <p class="story">This photo was taken in Q2 2024, after the restoration process was basically complete. 23 years after being originally purchased, Sheila had been returned to her former glory.
      Painted the 1967 GTO exclusive color "Plum Mist", she's quite the eyecatcher. All of her parts are original, minus the camshaft, exhaust and some small mechanical tidbits. While rebuilt, the engine is
      technically still original as well.
